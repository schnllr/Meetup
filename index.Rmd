# The state of corporate design @ STAT ZH

???

In this presentation by 'mastering CD' we do not mean perfectly layout and format everything and investing a lot of resources in it. It is about achieving visual coherence of different forms of publications by letting R do the job for you. We will present the functions & templates we have programmed in R that users will not use for the sake of complying with CD at any cost but for CONVENIENCE.

#The state of CD @ <font color=#009ee0>STAT ZH</font>

- Generic CD Guidelines for cantonal public administration cover the basics (e.g. fonts)
- No centralized publishing, several self-publishers
 - Infographics (Website & Twitter), Excel-Tables, statistik.info
 
- professionaly layouted publications are the exception

- How do we achieve <b>visual uniformity</b> of our products?

--

- <b>'Do it yourself' Corporate Design Toolbox</b>


???

The generic CD Guidelines provide a plenty of freedoms when it comes to design  - especially to units that publish data-products. We at the statistical Office have no centralized publishing. We are a group of self-publishers that produce infographics, Excel-tables and pdf-publications. So given this situation, how do we achieve a high degree of visual unifomirty? We are building a Corporate Desing Toolbox for this purpouse.

# ZH Colour Palette

class: center, middle

Not the ideal <font color=#009ee0>color-palette</font> for graphs.
```{r tidy=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
library(statR)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, fill=clarity))+ 
  geom_bar(position = "stack", width = 1)+
  scale_fill_manual(values=zhpal$zhcd)

```


???
The official cantonal CD-colors were made for other purpouses than data-visualization - mainly for the use in print publications produced with office products. Which explains why the palette is like it is.

### How we created our own color-scheme

<font color=#009ee0>How?</font>

- **Color palette creation** with R
 - Mute the cd colors (color interpolation)
 - Adapt the color space (LAB instead of RGB)
 - Creation of a color-matrix (varying hue AND saturation)
 - Testing for Colorblind-friendliness
 
<font color=#009ee0>Resources:</font>
 
**Interpolation** → grDevices::colorRampPalette()

**Colorblind-Testing** → Dichromat-package

???

Everyone was using his own palettes (mainly color brewer) - no consistence! So we decided to develop our own color scheme. Here you can see the steps of the color-sheme developemnt. We took the cd-colors, reorderer and muted them. Of course, we've adapted the colorspace to LAB instead of RGB. LAB is a color space that is optimized for the human eye better percevieng the different hues. Then i wrote a function on top of the colorRampPalette-Function that you can feed with a palette and it produces differently saturated (lighter and darker) versions of it, in equal steps. The result is a color matrix which you can see on the next slide. 

---
class: center,middle

```{r tidy=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(statR)
library(scales)

show_col(c(zhpal$zhdarker,zhpal$zhdark,zhpal$zh,zhpal$zhlight,zhpal$zhpastel,zhpal$zhextralight,zhpal$zhultralight), borders=FALSE)
```


---
class: center,middle


.pull-left[
```{r tidy=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
p = ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, fill=cut)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "stack", width= 0.5)

p +theme_stat() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=zhpal$zhdiagonal)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r tidy=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
library(dichromat)

p +theme_stat() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=dichromat(zhpal$zhdiagonal,type=c("tritan")))
```
]

???
As i said before, there is no strict obligation to use these colours-palettes for everything. thats also why its not like everyone is complying today, some people are still using their 'old' palettes. I call them the 'color-resistance'. and no i will not make names here. But by creating this color-scheme we have still reached the goal of achieving a high homogenity of how our charts look like - just by providing functions that are convenient to use.

If you should ever create your own palette you will have it tested for colorblindness.
The dichromat package is a great resource if you want to

The persuasion of the force of convenience will get more and more people to use our color scheme.

# Producing already formated XLSX-tables with R

## Our users love Excel-tables
100+ Excel-tables on our website<br>
Data is delivered in Excel-tables to users on a daily-basis<br>
No strict guidelines on how XLSX files should look like

.footnote[[<font color=#FFFFFF>Gif: Hoguemr, reddit<font>](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1gzksk/work_was_a_little_slow_for_me_this_morning_again/)]

???

The majority of our customers relies on Excel as a tool for data analysis. Thats why we have 100+ excel Tables on our website. We perform customer specific queries on a daily basis and deliver the data in Excel-tables. However there is a problem with this - for a long time, there haven't been any strict guidelines on how our XLSX Files should look like.

Even if you can do crazy stuff in Excel - i mean look at thisgif that i found on reddit, personally speaking, i see Exceltables as a mere Endproduct. I prefer not doing anykind of datamanipulation or extensive formatting in Excel. In order to keep everything reproducible i prefer getting straight out of R Excel files. Thats what motivated the creation of the Excel-functions.

In sake of uniformity and reproducability we are trying to improve this situation. Getting ones hands dirty and manually formating excel-files or even doing the last steps of data-manipulation in Excel is an error-prone task. Thats why i set up r-functions that allow for generating the final output without ever leaving R. This ensures reproducibility.

#statXLSX

Creating formated excel-tables straight-out-of-R saves time and reduces the risk of errors. We recurred to the [***openxlsx-package***](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openxlsx/openxlsx.pdf) package to define functions that write R-datasets in formated STAT ZH-Excel-tables.

***single worksheet***
statR::quickXLSX(data,"name of the table")

***multiple worksheets***
statR::statXLSX(data,"name of the table", worksheets)

***Advantages***

+End-to-end reproducibility

+quality assurance, less error prone

+visual coherence

???
The amount of time i spend with formatting excel-tables at work is directly correlated with job-dissatisfaction. i love my job. And to assure that this stays as it is i wrote these functions. There are several packages that allow to create xlsx files. I choose to build the functions on top of the openxlsx package. openxlsx does not dependend on Java, which has caused me trouble when using other excel-packages. 

We are planing to automatize the Excel-production and the functions will come into play in this process.

set up a RMarkdown file in RStudio render it with some tex-compiler through kniter and get the pdf. How can you custommize your pdf output? -> YAML header

]

???
let's get a bit deeper in the technical details. we see here a yaml header of a random RMarkdown file. In the yaml header you define your output type, pdf, html, word, whatever. according to the output section this file is going to produce a PDF document. furthermore, we have specified a latex_engine xelatex (necessary for arial fonts) and a cairo_pdf device for the graphics output. probably, we wish to make further adjustments to the output. we have (at least) 2 ways of making further customizations



---

class: left, top

# stat_report()

### Under the hood

**within YAML: header-includes**
```{r, eval = F, echo = T, tidy=T, tidy.opts=list(blank=FALSE, width.cutoff=30)}
---
header-includes:
  \usepackage{xcolor}
* \definecolor{zhblue}{RGB}{0,158,224}
  \usepackage{fontspec}
* \setmainfont[BoldFont = {Arial Black}]{Arial}
---
```
--
**stat_template.tex**
```{r, eval = F, echo = T, tidy=T, tidy.opts=list(blank=FALSE, width.cutoff=30)}
---
pdf_document:
*template: stat_template.tex
---
```


???
Probably you may want do make adjustments to the default .tex layout. like font, colors, title page etc. 2 ways of doing this: 
- in the header-includes: you can do the tex-adjustments, loading packages, define colors etc.
- you create you own my_template.tex and overwrite rmarkdowns default .tex file

# Build <font color=#009ee0>statRmd</font>  package

###  Why build a package?


- Code organization

- Consistent documentation

- Code distribution

<!-- - it has become pretty easy to do, thanks to    -->

<!-- .center[ -->
<!-- <IMG SRC="http://hexb.in/hexagons/devtools.png" width = "100" height = auto><IMG SRC="http://hexb.in/hexagons/roxygen2.png" width = "100" height = auto>] -->

- Templates

### Content

- RMarkdown Templates

- Some helper functions


???
as for every R project, there are many good reasons why to build a package. 
-it helps you keep your code organized. compared to having different code snippets and functions in project-specific folders
-it helps you document your codes in a way that your co-workers and your future-you will still understand you reasoning
-sharing a package comes more handy than sharing different functions and code snippets based on different package versions
- you can create doucment templates. for this specific case this is an excellent reason to build  package
along with the templates we provide some helpfer functions, to nicely align the graphics output in the document or to nicely wrap plot titles
